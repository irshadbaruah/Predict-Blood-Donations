# Predict-Blood-Donations
Forecasting blood supply is a serious and recurrent problem for blood collection managers.In this Project, you will work with data collected from the donor database of Blood TransfusionService Center.  The dataset, obtained from the Machine Learning Repository, consists of arandom sample of 748 donors. Your task will be to predict if a blood donor will donate within a giventime window. You will look at the full model-building process: from inspecting the dataset to usingthe tpot library to automate your Machine Learning pipeline. To complete this Project, you need to know some Python, pandas, and logistic regression...
